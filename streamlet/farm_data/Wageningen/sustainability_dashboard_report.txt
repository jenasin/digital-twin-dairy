- **Monthly Milk Income**: Calculated from milk yield data across various milking sessions.
- **Total Treatment and Feed Costs**: Derived from treatment data and cost per dose.
- **Profit or Loss Summary**: Estimated through comparison of total income versus treatment and feed costs.

## 🐄 Animal Health Status
- **% of Treated Cows**: Computed from health records indicating cows under treatment.
- **Average Duration of Treatments**: Correlated with treatment logs and repeated entries for the same illness.
- **Risk Profile of the Herd**: Evaluated from health status data (e.g., at risk, under treatment).

## 🌱 Environmental Metrics
- **Antibiotic Usage**: Frequency and dosage extracted from treatment logs.
- **Manure Production**: Estimated based on the number of animals and typical waste generation rates.
- **Any Sustainability Concerns**: Identified from overlapping antibiotic usage and health status.

## ✅ Recommendations
- Optimize feed and energy use to enhance profit margins.
- Implement strategic health interventions to reduce treatment frequency.
- Monitor and reduce antibiotic usage to align with best practices for environmental and animal health.
- Enhance data collection for more precise sustainability metrics, particularly in manure management.
