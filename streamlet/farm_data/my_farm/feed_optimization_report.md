## ü•õ Underperforming Cows

- **Cows with Low Milk Yield & High Lactations:**
  - **COW001** - Lactations: 5, Average daily yield: low
  - **COW197** - Lactations: 3, Average daily yield: low

- **Suggested Actions:**
  - Increase feed energy density particularly focusing on carbohydrates.
  - Consider supplementing with high-quality forages.
  - Ensure adequate fiber in the diet to support digestion.

## üêò Over-conditioned Cows

- **Potentially Overfed Cows:**
  - **COW003** - Age: 59 Months, Health Status: Healthy, Lactations: 3
  - **COW199** - Age: 53 Months, Health Status: Healthy, Lactations: 3

- **Recommendations:**
  - Monitor body condition score (BCS) regularly.
  - Reduce concentrate feed intake while maintaining fiber content.
  - Balance protein availability to match the lactation requirement.

## üß™ Feed Strategy Recommendations

- **Adjustments:**
  - **Increase Feed For:** Underperforming cows. Focus on energy-dense feeds.
  - **Reduce Feed For:** Over-conditioned cows. Adjust concentrate levels.

- **General Herd Strategy:**
  - Emphasize balanced nutrition with a focus on both macro and micro-nutrients.
  - Implement rotational grazing if possible, to increase forage intake.

- **Nutrient Imbalance Note:**
  - Possible imbalance in carbohydrate or protein levels. Monitor closely and adjust rations based on nutritional analyses.
