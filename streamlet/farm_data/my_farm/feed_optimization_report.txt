### Suggestions
- Reduce overall energy intake by decreasing the amount of concentrate feed.
- Introduce high-fiber forages like hay and silage to improve rumen health and satisfy hunger without excessive energy.
- Monitor body condition scores and adjust rations based on individual needs.

## üß™ Feed Strategy Recommendations
- Reduce concentrates and high-energy feeds for over-conditioned cows to prevent excessive weight gain.
- Increase protein and energy supplements for underperforming cows to boost milk yield.
- Enhance nutrient balancing by including mineral and vitamin premixes to meet the specific needs of different cow categories within the herd.
